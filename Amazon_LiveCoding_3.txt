Solution -> SearchService
-> APIS: 
1. add_new_books(List[Book])
2. remove_books(List[Book])
3. search_book(Query) -> List[Book]
4. re_validate_after_add()
5. re_validate_after_remove()

BookMangement(List[Book], int operation){
    //add new books 
    //update the BookDB
    re_validate_after_add(books);
    
}

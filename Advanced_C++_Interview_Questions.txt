-- What is a mutable storage class specifier? How can it be used?
Answer: 1. auto     --> lifetime : function block
        2. extern   --> lifetime : whole program
        3. static   --> lifetime : whole program
        4. register --> lifetime : function block
        5. mutable  --> lifetime : class


-- What are the differences between a shallow and a deep copy?
Answer:
    Shallow Copy: It stores the references of objects to the original memory address. Faster.
    Deep Copy: It stores copies of the object’s value. It’s comparatively slower.

-- What is an abstract class in C++?
Answer:
    An abstract class in C++ is referred to as the base class, which has at least one pure virtual function and is designed to be specifically used as a base class.


-- What is the function of scope resolution operator in C++?
Answer:
    - It’s denoted by the double colon (::) symbol.
    - They help to resolve the scope of various global variables.
    - When defined outside the class, a function allows associating the function with the class.

-- What is the diamond problem in C++?
Answer:
    as C++ allows inheritance with multiple class, this problem might occur. Here is an example:

    class A {
    public:
        void foo() {
            cout << "A::foo()" << endl;
        }
    };

    class B : public A {
    public:
        void foo() {
            cout << "B::foo()" << endl;
        }
    };

    class C : public A {
    public:
        void foo() {
            cout << "C::foo()" << endl;
        }
    };

    class D : public B, public C {
    };

    int main() {
        D d;
        d.foo(); // Which foo() method should be called?
        return 0;
    }

    to resolve: qualify the function calls (bit weird)
    int main() {
        D d;
        d.B::foo(); // Call B::foo()
        d.C::foo(); // Call C::foo()
        return 0;
    }

-- What is a “translation unit” in C++?
Answer:
    A translation unit consists of:
        - Contents of a source file
        - Plus contents of files included directly or indirectly
        - Minus source code lines ignored by any conditional preprocessing directives ( the lines ignored by #ifdef,#ifndef, etc.)

- You have a 100 coins laying flat on a table, each with a head side and a tail side. 10 of them are heads up, 90 are tails up.
- You can't feel, see or in any other way find out which side is up.
- Split the coins into two piles such that there are the same number of heads in each pile.

        120
        [30, 24, 20]

        4 x X = 120
        Numerical Bisection can be used:
        x : [4...120]
        4 x 64 > 120
        4 x 34 > 120
        4 x 19 < 120
        4 x 26 < 120
        4 x 29 < 120
        4 x 31 > 120
        4 x 30 = 120

        Mathemetics:
        X = 120 / 4
        Ln(X) = Ln(120/4)
        Ln(X) = Ln120 - Ln4
        X = e^(Ln120 - Ln4)

- There are three boxes, one contains only apples, one contains only oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges.
- The boxes have been incorrectly labeled such that no label identifies the actual contents of the box it labels.
- Opening just one box, and without looking in the box, you take out one piece of fruit. By looking at the fruit, how can you immediately label all of the boxes correctly?

Trick is to choose the box with "Apple + Orange"
